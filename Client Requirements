Client Requirements 
Background: 
A wealthy philanthropist, retired technology consultant and self-professed “nature lover” has partnered with representatives from both the national and state park systems to form a committee with the overarching goal of re-invigorating public interest in outdoor activities at our local & national parks.  
  This committee has identified that the online presence of the park systems is, to put it mildly, antiquated and confusing.  Furthermore, this committee has identified that most parks do not provide engaging activities for teens and young adults.  Under the guidance and funding provided by the wealthy philanthropist/technology guru, a project will be launched to design a complete revamping of national and state websites.  In addition, the committee will designate a park subject matter expert (SME) per state; this SME will answer any park-related questions pertaining to the state or national parks in their state.
Initially the committee has set these goals and requirements for the new website however they have noted that these items are subject to change as this project is still “evolving”:
-	A single, centralized website for all national and state parks featuring background info, pictures, videos, etc.
-	Support donations & online ticketing
-	Integrate with popular social media platforms
-	Provide some type of interactive “gaming” experience that appeals to teen/young adults which allows users to track parks visited
-	A technical review & status report roughly half-way through the project
-	A final product review & prototype demo in the late July/early August.  The winning design will be selected at this time.
